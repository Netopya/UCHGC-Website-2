    <h1>Dear brothers and sisters in Christ!</h1>
    <p>
        This Friday, March 25, the Holy Father Pope Francis dedicates all humanity, especially Russia and Ukraine, to the Immaculate Heart of the Virgin Mary.
        This consecration will take place in Rome at 5 o'clock (Roman time.)
        Catholics around the world are invited to join the Holy Father in prayer. I ask our parishioners to gather in our churches, homes, and workplaces at noon, Toronto, to read the attached Act of Consecration.
        On this occasion, on Friday, March 25, at 11 o'clock in the morning in our parish, we will celebrate the Prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary with a special Prayer of Consecration, which is offered to us for reading by Pope Francis.
