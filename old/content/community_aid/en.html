    <h1>Local Community Aid</h1>
    <p>
        Holy Ghost parish strives to be an inclusive and welcoming church home for our parishioners and members of the Ukrainian Canadian community, including newly-arrived displaced people from Ukraine. We hold community events such as hayilky, carolling, and pysanka workshops. In 2022, we have helped approximately 1000 Ukrainian displaced people with clothing, household items, and gift cards for fresh grocery and pharmacy items. Your gift will help sustain this grassroots community work.
