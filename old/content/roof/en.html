    <h1>Fundraising for roof replacement</h1>
    <p>
        The roof of our church has reached its lifespan and needs to be urgently replaced. The cost is
        astronomical, approximately $70,000, so we are asking for your help.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to help finance this project, a separate fundraising budget dedicated solely to the
        replacement of the roof has been set up.  Any amount you can afford to make would be greatly
        appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
        Donations can be made:
        <ol>
            <li>At church on Sunday following liturgy.  Please use a separate envelope.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/ukrainian-catholic-holy-ghost-church/campaign/roof-replacement-and-other-repairs/">Online</a></li>
            <li>By mailing your cheque to 1770 rue Centre, Montreal QC H3K 1H7.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please make your cheque payable to: Ukrainian Catholic Holy Ghost Church.  All donations will
        qualify for a tax receipt.
        <br />
        Please be generous.  Our parish membership is very small but extremely important to us all.
