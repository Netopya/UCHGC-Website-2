    <h1>New COVID-19 measures in effect as of December 20 2021</h1>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Passport vaccine will now be required to enter the church</li>
            <li>All worshippers must remain seated during liturgy</li>
            <li>It is obligatory to wear masks during liturgy</li>
        </ul>
        We are permitted to have a maximum of 89 persons in church during Liturgy. Going over this limit puts us at risk of incurring a fine of 6 000$ per person. For this reason after we have reached this number our front door will be locked.<br>
