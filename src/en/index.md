## Current Community Projects

### How can I help Ukraine?

Make your donations:
- [Catholic Near East Welfare Association](https://cnewa.org/ca/campaings/ukraine/)
- [Canadian Red Cross](https://donate.redcross.ca/page/100227/donate/1)

### Fundraising for roof replacement

The roof of our church has reached its lifespan and needs to be urgently replaced. The cost is approximately $70,000, so we are asking for your help.

In order to help finance this project, a separate fundraising budget dedicated solely to the replacement of the roof has been set up. Any amount you can afford to make would be greatly appreciated.

Donations can be made:
1. At church on Sunday following liturgy. Please use a separate envelope.
2. [Online through CanadaHelps](https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/ukrainian-catholic-holy-ghost-church/campaign/roof-replacement-and-other-repairs/)
3. By mailing your cheque to 1770 rue Centre, Montreal QC H3K 1H7.

Please make your cheque payable to: Ukrainian Catholic Holy Ghost Church. All donations will qualify for a tax receipt.

Please be generous. Our parish membership is very small but extremely important to us all.

Thank you.

### Local Community Aid

Holy Ghost parish strives to be an inclusive and welcoming church home for our parishioners and members of the Ukrainian Canadian community, including newly-arrived displaced people from Ukraine. We hold community events such as hayilky, carolling, and pysanka workshops. In 2022, we have helped approximately 1000 Ukrainian displaced people with clothing, household items, and gift cards for fresh grocery and pharmacy items. Your gift will help sustain this grassroots community work.

### Prayer of Pope Francis

O Mary, you shine continuously on our journey as a sign of salvation and hope.
We entrust ourselves to you, Health of the Sick. At the foot of the Cross you participated in Jesus' pain, with steadfast faith. You, Salvation of the human race, know what we need.
We are certain that you will provide, so that, as you did at Cana of Galilee, joy and feasting might return after this moment of trial.
Help us, Mother of Divine Love, to conform ourselves to the Father's will and to do what Jesus tells us. He who took our sufferings upon Himself and bore our sorrows to bring us through the Cross, to the joy of Resurrection.
We seek refuge under your protection, O holy Mother of God. Do not despise pur pleas – we who are put to the test – and deliver us from every danger, O glorious and blessed Virgin. Amen.
