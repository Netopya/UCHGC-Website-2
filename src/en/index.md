## Current Community Projects

### How can I help Ukraine?

Make your donations:
- [Catholic Near East Welfare Association](https://cnewa.org/ca/campaings/ukraine/)
- [Canadian Red Cross](https://donate.redcross.ca/page/100227/donate/1)

### Fundraising for roof replacement

The roof of our church has reached its lifespan and needs to be urgently replaced. The cost is approximately $70,000, so we are asking for your help.

In order to help finance this project, a separate fundraising budget dedicated solely to the replacement of the roof has been set up. Any amount you can afford to make would be greatly appreciated.

Donations can be made:
1. At church on Sunday following liturgy. Please use a separate envelope.
2. [Online through CanadaHelps](https://www.canadahelps.org/en/charities/ukrainian-catholic-holy-ghost-church/campaign/roof-replacement-and-other-repairs/)
3. By mailing your cheque to 1770 rue Centre, Montreal QC H3K 1H7.

Please make your cheque payable to: Ukrainian Catholic Holy Ghost Church. All donations will qualify for a tax receipt.

Please be generous. Our parish membership is very small but extremely important to us all.

Thank you.
